1       INSERT - TV COMMERCIAL - DAY                                   1

Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving
through brush from the POV of a stalking animal. As the
brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock
Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN.

            GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
The world of investing can be a
jungle.

1A      WE SEE a charging, snorting BULL.                             1A

             GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
Bulls.

1B      WE SEE a ferocious, growling BEAR.                            1B

             GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
Bears.   Danger at every turn.

Pretentious CLASSICAL MUSIC kicks in.

            GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.

1C-1D   VARIOUS SHOTS -- a conservative young MAN reviews a stock   1C-1D
portfolio with a wealthy older COUPLE; a smiling young
WOMAN sits before a computer talking into a headset.

            GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
Trained professionals to guide you
through the financial wilderness.

1E      WE SEE the Stratton "team" - an ethnically diverse group      1E
of ACTORS with their handsome, grey-templed "CHAIRMAN".

            GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
Stratton Oakmont. Stabilty.
Integrity. Pride.

1F      WE SEE a shot of the black glass Stratton Building, and:      1F


2       INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY   (FEB `95)          2

Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their
early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30,
stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.

            JORDAN
Twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

The "bullseye" is a large dollar sign in the middle of a
giant velcro "dartboard".
                                                 2.
The Wolf of Wall Street      Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

            JORDAN (CONT'D)
Watch and learn, people!

The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his
pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets
are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the "dartboard".

                 JORDAN (CONT'D)
One.   Two.      Throw!!

The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes
flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:

            JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My name is Jordan Belfort. No, not                      *
him, me. I'm a former member of                         *
the middle class raised by two
accountants in a tiny apartment in
Bayside, Queens.


3-3B   A SERIES OF POLAROIDS -- (1969)                                    3-3B
                                                      *

Jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand,
his parents Max and Leah behind him; Jordan, 13, stands
holding a styrofoam cooler, selling ices on the beach;
Jordan, 18, smiles as he holds an Amway sales brochure.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
The year I turned 26, I made 49
million dollars as the head of
my own brokerage firm--


4      EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - DAY        (FEB `95)                     4

A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
--which really pissed me off
because it was three shy of a
million a week.

The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
Hey, my Ferrari was white, like
Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away,
a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordan's lap.


5      EXT. LONG ISLAND'S NORTH SHORE - DAY          (FEB `95)                5

A twin-engine Bell Jet helicopter descends over a huge
mansion, with sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.
                                                3.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

            JORDAN (V.O.)
See that humongous estate down
there? That's my house.


6      INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY      (FEB `95)          6

We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream
in LaPerla lingerie.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay
Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model
and Miller Lite girl.

Naomi licks her lips; she's incredibly, painfully hot.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
Yeah, she was the one blowing me
in the Ferrari, so put your dick
back in your pants.

Over the following, WE SEE a quick


7-7C   SERIES OF SHOTS                                                   7-7C

All taken from TV; a mansion from Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous; wealthy PEOPLE applauding at a polo match;
a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; Robert Wagner and
Stephanie Powers toasting with champagne on Hart to Hart.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
In addition to Naomi and my two
perfect kids, I own a mansion,
private jet, six cars, three
horses, two vacation homes and
a 170 foot yacht.


8      INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT (FEB `95)                                8

Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC
HOOKER from behind.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
I also gamble like a degenerate,
drink like a fish, fuck hookers
maybe five times a week and have
three different Federal agencies
looking to indict me.

He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses
it to blow some into her asshole.

            JORDAN (V.O.)
Oh yeah, and I love drugs.
                                              4.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages      3/5/13

Jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if he's hearing
voices.


9    INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT     (FEB `95)                             9

Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a
rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of
controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.

           CAPTAIN DAVE
Pull up!   Jesus! We're gonna
crash!!

Jordan's head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.
The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering
30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through
Jordan's hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling
pool, tennis court and waterfall.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
Check this out -- despite my
completely fucked-up state, I
could fly straight while still
seeing two of everything.

He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on
the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the
driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.

          JORDAN
 (to Captain Dave)
Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,
buddy.


10   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - FRONT DOOR - DAY      (FEB `95)            10

Morning. Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan
heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
Yes, on a daily basis I take
enough drugs to sedate greater
Long Island.


11   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - CONTINUOUS       (FEB `95)                 11

He pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks
directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

          JORDAN
I take Quaaludes for my back,
fifteen to twenty a day.
                                           5.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
          JORDAN (CONT'D)
I use Xanax to stay focused,
ambien to sleep, pot to mellow
out, cocaine to wake up and
morphine because it's awesome.


12   EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LONG ISLAND - DAY     (FEB `95)    12

The limo pulls up to the black glass office building.
Jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.

          JORDAN
But of all the drugs under God's
blue heaven, there's one that's my
absolute favorite.


13   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY (FEB `95)    13

Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With
the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses
a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he
peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:

          JORDAN
Enough of this shit'll make you
invincible, able to conquer the
world and eviscerate your enemies.

He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.

          JORDAN (CONT'D)
I'm not talking about this. I'm
talking about this.
 (Jordan unfurls the
  $100 with a SNAP)
Money is the oxygen of capitalism
and I wanna breathe more than any
other human being alive.

He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner,
where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his
back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds
like the ROAR of a mob--

          JORDAN (V.O.)
Money doesn't just buy you a
better life -- better food, better
cars, better pussy -- it also
makes you a better person. You
can give generously to the church
of your choice or the political
party. You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.
                                                6.

14    INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY         (FEB `95)        14

Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open
space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.

           JORDAN (V.O.)
But most of all, in any country in
the world, money can buy you love.
Fuck the Beatles.

His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off,
scream wildly. They worship him.

           JORDAN (V.O.)
With that in mind, at the tender
age of 22, after marrying my
girlfriend Teresa--


14A   SCENES 14A - 18 OMITTED                                            14A


19    EXT. WALL STREET - DAY      (MAY `87)                              19

An express bus pull up -- its sign reads "Wall
Street"....

           JORDAN (V.O.)
--I headed to the only place that
befit my high-minded ambitions...

Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea
of Commuters heading to work.

           JERRY FOGEL (PRE-LAP)
You are lower than fucking pond
scum.


20    INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY       (MAY `87)               20

Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45
shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals,
readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows
broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...

           JERRY FOGEL
You got a problem with that?
  (reads name tag)
Jordan?

            JORDAN
Nope.   No problem at all.
                                       7.
The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

     JERRY FOGEL
Your job is `connector', which
means you'll be dialing the phone
over 500 times a day, trying to
`connect' me with business owners.
And till you pass your Series 7,
that's all you'll be doing. Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel's.

     JERRY FOGEL (CONT'D)
Just so you know, last year I made
over 300k and the other guy you'll
be working for made a million.

     JORDAN (V.O.)
A million dollars? I could only
imagine what a douchebag that guy
must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK
HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

      MARK HANNA
Jordan? Mark Hanna.
(re: Fogel)
Good, you've met Jerry. One of
the smartest guys in the office.
Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out
of loneliness.

Fogel's smile turns to a frown.      He hands Jordan a stack
of 3x5 index cards.

     JERRY FOGEL
Smile and dial. And don't pick
your fucking head up till one.

     MARK HANNA
Don't mind Jerry, his father raped
him as a child. Besides, I'm
senior broker here, he's a
worthless piker. I heard you
pitched stock at your job
interview.

     JORDAN
Had to do something to stand out.

     MARK HANNA
I fuckin' love that! Let's grab
lunch later. Windows good with
you?

        JORDAN
Great.   Yeah.
                                        8.
The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant
electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.

        MARK HANNA
Let's fuck!!

RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the
opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers
and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA
PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.

     BROKER #1
(to Broker #2)
Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal!
Thirty eight bucks a share!

      MARK HANNA
(into headset)
Your broker in West Virginia?
What are you buying, a coal mine?
It's the 80s, the game is high-
tech.

     BROKER #2
(to Broker #3)
Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!

     JORDAN (V.O.)
You want to know what money sounds
like? Visit a trading floor on
Wall Street. Fuck this, shit
that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I
couldn't believe how these guys
talked to each other--

Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen.        He covers his
mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

     JERRY FOGEL
Dial the cocksucking phone!

Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

     JORDAN (V.O.)
I was hooked within seconds.

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a
"buy" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder
which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

     JORDAN (V.O.)
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we're suddenly--
                                           9.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

21   INT. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD - DAY     (MAY `87)                  21

CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a
nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the
city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around
as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other
DINERS seem to notice or care.

          MARK HANNA
 (offering the spoon)
Got enough for one more? Tootski?

           JORDAN
No.   Thanks though.

Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the
tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches.

          HECTOR
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?

Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan
notices.

          MARK HANNA
Here's the game plan, Hector.
Bring us two Absolut Martinis
straight up. Precisely seven and
a half minutes after you deliver
those you'll bring two more, then
two more every five minutes until
one of us passes out.

          HECTOR
An excellent strategy, sir.

          JORDAN
Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.

Jordan might as well have farted at the table.

           MARK HANNA
First day on Wall Street, Hector.
Give him time.
 (Hector offers menus)
No thanks, I'm not eating.

Hector heads off.

          JORDAN
You can get high during the day
and still function?
                                     10.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

     MARK HANNA
High is the only way to do this
fucking job. Guy who coined the
term "three-martini lunch" was a
woman. Cocaine and hookers, my
friend, the keys to success.

Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.

      JORDAN
I gotta say, I'm really excited
about being part of your team.
I wanna do all I can for our
clients and --

     MARK HANNA
(reciting an ad)
"Here at L.F. Rothschild, our
clients aren't just important,
they're family." Just as long as
we get our taste first. Remember
something, Jordan, your top
priority in this job: make us
money. If the clients get rich
along the way, bully for them.
Got a girlfriend?

      JORDAN
Wife.   She cuts hair.

Mark swallows a comment about that.      Gets to business.

     MARK HANNA
OK, first rule of Wall Street.
Nobody -- and I don't care if
you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet -- nobody knows if a
stock's going up, down or fucking
sideways, least of all stock
brokers. But we have to pretend
we know. Make sure you stay
relaxed. Nobody wants to buy
something from someone who sounds
like they haven't gotten laid in a
month. Take breaks when you feel
stressed, jerk off if you can.
You like jerking off, right?

       JORDAN
Well... sure.

     MARK HANNA
Good, jerking off is key. And I
highly recommend cocaine, which
will make you dial faster, which
is good for me. Churn `em and
burn `em, baby.
                                          11.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks
him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh
vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort.
Jordan realizes: that's why he palmed the maitre d' $100.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
For the next six months I learned
the ways of Wall Street.


22   INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT    (OCT `87)                           22

As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna
and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a
martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
That fall I passed my Series 7.
Finally it was here.


23   INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY      (OCT `87)          23

Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a
dozen other BROKERS.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
My first day as a stockbroker, a
future Master of the Universe.

And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE:

    OCTOBER 19th, 1987


24   INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY      (OCT `87)            24

Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him
Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
They called it Black Monday.
By four p.m. the market was down
508 points, the biggest one-day
drop since the crash of `29.

4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes
silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.

           MARK HANNA
Holy.   Fucking. Shit.

And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...
                                            12.
The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

          JORDAN (V.O.)
L.F. Rothschild, a company that
had been in business since 1883,
closed its doors within a month.


25   INT. JORDAN & TERESA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC `87)       25

Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds.
Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.

          TERESA
So I'll take an extra shift, don't
worry about it.

          JORDAN
You work too much as it is.

          TERESA
We could pawn my engagement ring.

          JORDAN
We're not pawning anything. I'm
gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.

          TERESA
You know that doesn't matter,
right?

He smiles, kisses her.     Together, they peruse the ads.

          JORDAN
 (points to an ad)
"Nobody Beats the Wiz".      I could
be a stock boy.

          TERESA
You're a stock broker.

          JORDAN
No one's hiring brokers right now,
sweetie.

They go back to the ads.     After a few beats, she points--

             TERESA
This place is.


26   EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY (DEC `87)      26

In a suit, Jordan emerges from an `85 Datsun. He looks
around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.
                                          13.

27   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY     (DEC `87)                     27

The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture
and a dozen misfit "BROKERS" giving loud, obnoxious sales
pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people.
DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

          JORDAN
I'm looking for Investor's Center?

          DWAYNE
That's us, hey. Dwayne.

          JORDAN
 (as they shake hands)
Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.
I was a broker with Rothschild.

Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in
ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.

          TOBY WELCH
I'm tellin' you, this stock is
goin' up!... Cause I know,
okay?!... I have inside
information!

Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he's hearing.

          JORDAN
Where are your quotrons?

          DWAYNE
No quotrons, we sell off the pink
sheets -- penny stocks.

Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are
literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:

          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
Company don't have enough capital
to be listed on NASDAQ, their
shares trade here.
 (points to the book)
Like these guys, Aerotyne? They
make radar detectors out of a
garage in Dubuque.

          JORDAN
Six cents a share? Who buys this
crap?

          DWAYNE
Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
plumbers, people thinking they can
get rich quick. They answer our
ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
                                             14.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

          JORDAN
The spread on these is huge.

          DWAYNE
So's your commission, that's the
point. Blue chips stocks you get
what, one percent? Pink sheets
are fifty.

          JORDAN
Wait a second. You're telling me
if I sell two thousand dollars
worth of stock, my commission is a
thousand bucks?

          DWAYNE
Technically, yeah, but not even
the biggest schmuck buys two
thousand dollars of this shit.


28   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY       (DEC '87)         28

As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone
cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:

          JORDAN
 (into phone)
Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan
Belfort with Investor's Center in
New York City. You recently
responded to one of our ads...

A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

          JORDAN (CONT'D)
The reason I'm calling is that
an extremely exciting investment
opportunity crossed my desk today.
Typically our firm recommends no
more than five stocks per year:
this is one of them...

A few more Brokers look over...

          JORDAN (CONT'D)
Aerotyne International is a
cutting edge tech firm out of the
Midwest, awaiting imminent patent
approval on a new generation of
radar equipment...

LATER.   Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.
                                          15.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

          JORDAN (CONT'D)
-- so if Aerotyne's shares rise
to only a dollar -- and our
research indicates they could go
much, much higher -- your profit
on a mere three thousand dollar
investment would be upwards of
fifty thousand... That's right,
you could pay off your mortgage.

Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

          JORDAN (CONT'D)
Four thousand dollars, will
that be check or money order?...
Thank you, sir.

Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket.

          JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Just like that I made two grand.
The other guys looked at me like
I'd just discovered fire.

Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him.

          TOBY WELCH
How'd you fuckin' do that?


29   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB `88)               29

Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.

          JORDAN
It's a rock-solid company, sir,
it's the next Microsoft...
Six thousand. Terrific.

As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...

          JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Though I knew I was selling
garbage, within twelve weeks I
was making a fortune.

And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...

          JORDAN (V.O.)
And as a wise man once told me,
my only responsibility was to
put meat on the table.

CLOSE ON a 1988 Jaguar, parked outside a diner...

30    INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY        (JUN `88)                 30

Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall
Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE
AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright
white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.

           DONNIE
That your Jag in the lot?

               JORDAN
Yeah.

               DONNIE
Nice ride.      Donnie Azoff.

           JORDAN
Jordan Belfort.

           DONNIE
I've seen it around. We live in
the same building. Twelfth floor?
  (Jordan nods)
What do you do, bro?

               JORDAN
Stock broker.

           DONNIE
Kids furniture, me and my brother-
in-law. Making any money?

           JORDAN
Seventy grand last month.

           DONNIE
Get the fuck out. You made
seventy grand in one month.

           JORDAN
Seventy two actually.

Donnie studies him, isn't sure if he's full of shit.

           DONNIE
Tell you what. You show me a pay
stub with $72,000 on it, I'm
quitting my job right now and
coming to work with you.

As Jordan retrieves his briefcase to find a paystub --           *

30A   SCENE 30A OMITTED                                                *30A

30B   As Jordan hands Donnie his paystub and sure enough, it's         *30B

            DONNIE (CONT'D)                      *
Holy shit.

Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and
dials.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
And he did quit his job, which
I thought was a little weird.
I mean I had just met this
fucking guy.

A few beats, then into phone:

          DONNIE
Yo Paulie, it's Donnie...     Yeah,
listen, I quit.

Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...

          JORDAN (V.O.)
There were other things about him
too, like his phosphorescent white
teeth and the fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses to
look more Waspy. He also married
his first cousin --

31   SCENE 31 OMITTED                                                    31


32   INT. BAR - DAY   (JUN `88)                                      * 32

Jordan sits in mid-conversation with Donnie over beers.

          DONNIE
No problem, if we have a kid who's
a retard, we'll just leave it on
the steps of some institution.

And as they continue drinking...

          JORDAN (V.O.)
He was also a closet drug fiend.
I'd known him less than a week
before he talked me into smoking
crack.


33   EXT. BACK OF BAR - DAY     (JUN `88)                            * 33

Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a
crack pipe.
                                             18.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

          JORDAN (V.O.)
The weird thing was when he'd do
crack, his face would contort into
this bizarre, frozen mask like the
Phantom of the Opera.

Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his
facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim.
After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.

          DONNIE
You now, take a hit!

Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it.      A beat, then:

          JORDAN
Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!

          JORDAN (V.O.)
I knew I had to make him my
partner.


34   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY     (SEP `88)                            34

Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
Which turned out to be a great
move - Donnie was a fast learner
who transitioned into the penny
stock business quickly.


35   EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP - DAY       (SEP `88)             35

Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop,
which has a "For Lease" sign in the window.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
So within months we started our
own firm out of an abandoned auto
body shop.


36   INT. KACANDES DINER - DAY    (OCT `88)                                36

Jordan sits with CHESTER MING, ROBBIE FEINBERG, ALDEN
KUPFERBERG ("SEA OTTER") and BRAD, muscular and bald,
with a Fu Manchu mustache.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
In addition to Donnie, I also
recruited my friends Sea Otter,                        *
Chester and Robbie, who were at                        *
the time all middling pot dealers.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

As a WAITRESS serves cheeseburgers:

          JORDAN
--see everyone wants to get rich,
so you're already half way there
by the time the call starts.

          SEA OTTER
I sold weed once to this Amish
dude, had one of those beards with
no mustache?

            ROBBIE FEINBERG
So?

          SEA OTTER
He only wanted to make furniture.

          CHESTER MING
What's that got to do with
anything?

          SEA OTTER
He just said everyone wants to
get rich.

          ROBBIE FEINBERG
 (to Jordan)
That's true, you did.

          SEA OTTER
Buddhists too, they don't give a
shit about money either.

          CHESTER MING
Man I could sell weed to anybody,
get a convent full of nuns fucking
wasted.

And as Brad looks at Jordan and shakes his head:


37   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN              37
(OCT `88)

We see the above guys working the phones.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
Brad, the guy I really wanted,
took a pass, since he'd become the
Quaalude king of Bayside.


38   EXT. BRAD'S HOUSE - BACKYARD GYM - DAY       (OCT `88)          38

Bare-chested, wearing kung fu pants, Brad sells ludes to
a couple of HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.
                                            20.
The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

They were absolute morons, my
friends, but like I always said--


39   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN - DAY         39
(OCT `88)

Jordan emerges from his office into the garage area
(the bullpen), looking on as Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Sea
Otter and four other BROKERS (now including RUGRAT and
Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.

          JORDAN (V.O.)
Give me them young, hungry and
stupid and in no time I'll make
them rich.


40   EXT. MARINA - LONG ISLAND - SUNSET        (MAY `89)              40

On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine
nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa. He smiles as she opens
a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.

           TERESA
Omigod.   Jordan.

              JORDAN
You like it?

          TERESA
It's beautiful.

Jordan helps her try it on.       She smiles, but he detects a
wave of... something.

          JORDAN
They're small, I know, but the
stones are really high quality.</p>
